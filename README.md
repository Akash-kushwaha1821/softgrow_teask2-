# Housing Price Prediction

This project is a simple machine learning web application built using Python and the Streamlit framework. The app predicts housing prices based on selected features from the California Housing dataset available in scikit-learn.

The application loads the dataset, performs preprocessing such as feature selection and normalization, and trains a Linear Regression model to predict house prices. It also displays model performance metrics and a visualization comparing actual and predicted values. Users can interact with sliders to enter their own feature values and see predicted housing prices in real time.

This project demonstrates basic concepts of data preprocessing, regression modeling, visualization, and building interactive machine learning applications.
